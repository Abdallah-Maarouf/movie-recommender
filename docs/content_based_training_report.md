# Content-Based Filtering Model Training Report

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the content-based filtering model trained for the movie recommendation system. Content-based filtering recommends items based on their features and characteristics, making it complementary to collaborative filtering approaches.

## Content-Based Filtering Approach

### Core Concept
Content-based filtering recommends movies by analyzing movie features (genres, year, metadata) and finding similar movies based on content characteristics. It creates user profiles based on the features of movies they've rated highly.

### Key Advantages
- **Cold Start Solution**: Can recommend new movies without any ratings
- **Explainable Recommendations**: "Because you liked Action movies from the 1990s..."
- **User Independence**: Doesn't require other users' data
- **Diversity Control**: Can ensure genre diversity in recommendations

## Dataset Features Analysis

### Available Movie Features
- **MovieID**: Unique identifier
- **Title**: Movie title with year
- **Genres**: Pipe-separated genre list (e.g., "Action|Adventure|Sci-Fi")
- **Year**: Release year (1919-2000)
- **GenreList**: Parsed list of genres
- **CleanTitle**: Title without year

### Engineered Features
1. **Genre Features**: TF-IDF vectorization of genres
2. **Temporal Features**: Year normalization, decade grouping, era classification
3. **Popularity Features**: Rating count, user count, popularity score
4. **Quality Features**: Average rating, quality score (rating × popularity)
5. **Diversity Features**: Genre count, title length metrics

## Model Architecture

### Feature Engineering Pipeline

#### 1. Text Features (TF-IDF)
- **Input**: Genre strings and era information
- **Processing**: TF-IDF vectorization with bigrams
- **Parameters**: 
  - Max features: 1,000
  - Min document frequency: 2
  - Max document frequency: 0.8
  - N-gram range: (1, 2)

#### 2. Numerical Features
- **Year Normalization**: Min-max scaling of release years
- **Decade Grouping**: Movies grouped by decade (1960s, 1970s, etc.)
- **Era Classification**: Classic, Retro, Eighties, Nineties, Modern
- **Popularity Metrics**: Log-scaled rating counts and user engagement

#### 3. Statistical Features
- **Average Rating**: Mean rating across all users
- **Rating Standard Deviation**: Rating variability
- **Number of Ratings**: Total rating count
- **Number of Users**: Unique user count
- **Quality Score**: Rating weighted by popularity

### Similarity Computation
- **Method**: Cosine similarity on combined feature vectors
- **Feature Combination**: TF-IDF + normalized numerical features
- **Output**: Movie-movie similarity matrix (3,883 × 3,883)

## Training Configuration

### Feature Processing
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: Captures genre and temporal patterns
- **Standard Scaler**: Normalizes numerical features
- **Feature Combination**: Concatenates TF-IDF and numerical features

### Similarity Matrix
- **Computation**: Cosine similarity on combined features
- **Dimensionality**: Full movie catalog similarity
- **Storage**: Pandas DataFrame for efficient lookup

### User Profile Creation
- **Method**: Weighted average of rated movie features
- **Weighting**: Rating-based (higher ratings contribute more)
- **Normalization**: Profile vectors normalized by total weight

## Expected Performance Metrics

### Content-Based Evaluation
- **RMSE**: Expected 1.2-1.5 (higher than collaborative filtering)
- **MAE**: Expected 0.9-1.2
- **Reason**: Content-based typically has higher error than collaborative

### Diversity Metrics
- **Genre Coverage**: Percentage of genres represented in recommendations
- **Genre Entropy**: Diversity measure of genre distribution
- **Expected Coverage**: 80-90% of available genres

### Recommendation Quality
- **Movie-to-Movie**: High similarity for same genre/era movies
- **User-based**: Recommendations matching user's genre preferences
- **Cold Start**: Effective for new movies with no ratings

## Implementation Details

### Feature Engineering Process
1. **Load movie metadata** and rating statistics
2. **Extract genre features** using TF-IDF
3. **Create temporal features** (year, decade, era)
4. **Calculate popularity metrics** from ratings data
5. **Normalize numerical features** using StandardScaler
6. **Combine all features** into unified matrix

### Similarity Computation
1. **Create combined feature matrix** (TF-IDF + numerical)
2. **Compute cosine similarity** between all movie pairs
3. **Store similarity matrix** for efficient recommendations
4. **Index by MovieID** for fast lookup

### Recommendation Generation
1. **Movie-to-Movie**: Find most similar movies by content
2. **User-based**: Create user profile from rated movies
3. **Score unrated movies** against user profile
4. **Rank by similarity** and return top-K

## Evaluation Strategy

### Content-Based Metrics
- **Rating Prediction**: Compare predicted vs actual ratings
- **Similarity Validation**: Manual inspection of similar movies
- **Genre Consistency**: Verify genre-based recommendations

### Diversity Analysis
- **Genre Coverage**: Percentage of genres in recommendations
- **Genre Distribution**: Entropy of genre representation
- **Temporal Diversity**: Era and decade distribution

### Cold Start Performance
- **New Movie Recommendations**: Test with movies having few ratings
- **Genre-based Recommendations**: Verify genre consistency
- **Temporal Recommendations**: Check era-appropriate suggestions
